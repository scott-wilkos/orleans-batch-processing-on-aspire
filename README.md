## Sample prerequisites

This sample is written in C# and targets .NET 8.0. It requires the [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or later.

## Building the sample

To download and run the sample, follow these steps:

1. Clone the `https://github.com/scott-wilkos/orleans-batch-processing-on-aspire` repository.
2. In Visual Studio (2022 or later):
    1. On the menu bar, choose **File** > **Open** > **Project/Solution**.
    2. Navigate to the folder that holds the sample code, and open the solution (.sln) file.
    3. Right click the _BatchProcessing.AppHost_ project in the solution explore and choose it as the startup project.
    4. Choose the <kbd>F5</kbd> key to run with debugging, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> keys to run the project without debugging.
3. From the command line:
   1. Navigate to the folder that holds the sample code.
   2. At the command line, type [`dotnet run`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run).

To run the game, run the .NET Aspire app by executing the following at the command prompt (opened to the base directory of the sample):

``` bash
dotnet run --project BatchProcessing.AppHost
```

1. On the **Resources** page, click on one of the endpoints for the **webfrontend** project. This launches the simple .NET app.
2. In the .NET app:
    1. Navigate to the **Engine Simulator** menu.
